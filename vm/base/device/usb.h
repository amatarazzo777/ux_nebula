USB and driver software support are a promise usefulness. Luckily the format of usb
and the types are friendly. Linux supports many types of usb and block
level device formats already. 


Data marches for high bandwidth devices, need externalization. The expansion of USB speeds
are very wonderful. Yet in reality the design is still cumbersome. A way to place a oblong
shape that holds data into a cradle, and have it slide into the device for reading and 
also power is more modern. The dreamers of the cd/ dvd and dlue ray use this method.
For a data device, perhaps it could be a measure of how many the device can hold within a tray,
inside the laptop or computer. I think this makes it more user friendly than a plug,
or carrying it in another location.
