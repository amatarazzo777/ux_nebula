The human interface device connected to to focus device. 

Keyboard is to be listed as a HID device, currently linked into the 
message os queue event system. OS as well.


Touchscreen

midi keyboard - most are usb oriented. driver to music dydtem from the usb driver.
can the code be shortened through new style. Language?

Many keyboards, some not around anymore. How to organize the database and place it
into the new database format for system use., Routines that modularly plug the usb 
to the event system. 
A method of entry exists, such as pressing all the keys and saving the codes. If one 
person does it for a particular type of keyboard, it is functional. Yet
as always, the more functional aspect is through object shape recorgnition. All of those
tiny icons, need explanination to the computer system. At times a catalog is established
already for keyboards. The consolidated list, I am unaware of. Yet some other attributes of 
types of alternate shift like placing the curls above the n or something. By providing midi
attachments, a foot pedal could be used in such situations. Another english joke made 
improperly. Yet that is to say there say specific language attributes other than upper or 
lower case that are interesting. These systems are often reflected in what people are alble to 
buy. There are other types of order systems, Dovardak insteand of QWERTY. Most likely
would seem mystical. Yet for the English lanauge, this provides input. I am happy with the system
of buttons. 


joysticks
  Many joysticks, many options. Often very easy to 
  utilize using the usb driver. linux has a system 
  that provides input. By applying the usb api and mini driver,
  with event system. Functional feedback. 

gamepads


human interface devices that are programed and compiled for specific types of drawing recognition
and interaction of tools, apart from the drawing, cardboard per visual qr codes. 7 of 9 is smaller.
the ability to strategically place these can provide an allotment of software objects.

Transport controls simply printed on a card and the camera becomes the input device.

A flat mat, usb powered contains the materials to sense velocity. touching, in
a lower res grid. Perhaps cells are built for world sizes. Important is velocity
sensing through it. A fabric on top, that is drawn can transmit the touch events,
Or using powered finger tips, that measure distance, and pressure. menu contexts could be controlled
by finger gesture very accurately, provided finger tips were sensitive. Versitile input controls
for music. Gestures could be personalitized, and wireless. 


Another very real aspect of the actual provisions of a video instrument, is the expectation
that only one exists, or, there is not a clipping area. For example, as a physical device
the panio keyboard setup is a tuned mechanism is a hammer through lever action. The system of 
weights balanced within the contrstuction design, to establish finger hammers. The strings, steel,
or select for the design. Felt on tighter strings provided the pluck. 

Yet as a physical device, for video, one does not need a these all of the provision to make sound.
If a keyboard would extend a type of projection for the camera frame. A processing of OSR, within the 
embedded design according to a timing function. It could be formed, as known distaces,
between the entire surface. An optical physical design with a scan rate. Often too much data
may be gathered by the camera. Clipping a 32 key with perhaps a 1 or 2 cm ruler in bank. For
practical embedded design, physically playing at a scan rate of even 5 per second can be playable.
The granularity controlled by the effectiveness of the design as a data shipping requirement 
of pixel space from the camera. A portion wasted due to excluding the hammer and key functionality.
By acheiveing a rate as well as distance, some data will be advanced to capture from the simple optical
design. Such as after touch, and speed measurements. The ability to achieve it with the mini tabs
and camera, and be home tested, and then scaled down to a product keyboard design to offer more
types of musical data to model the finger hammer design. Optical switches that are not binary,
but depend on a type of physical movement. The compartment would be hidden. So light, perhaps
people would feel ripped off from the tech. Perhapd could even have a completely inflatable design,
where the mechanisms and joints for the texttile finger input, is rivieted air tight on a join,
a frictional and restrictive surface join, tool have this such as ball bearings, and locks
the prevent complete revolution. Fully inflated, with air, and camera, the keyboard plays,
Perhaps with baloons a playable panio and drumset could be possible. 

Having OSR and input scanning mechanism from video sources or guided physical optical
switches. A mixing panel for entering in various associated tracks. Sekected 
real time play modes. XY Controller automation. The frame shot of a keyboard
may not be enough. As well, the data from midi is much less than a streaming video,
with sound.

To think about a keyboard of this sort, as a dual constructed device. Materials,
and return position memory of the key. Interior keys often have a vertical switch
that connects with the sensors array. So information is lost, from the direct connecting
sensors of on at the hinge sensor. A better reading for use. Plastic springs that last,
can stiffen the movement. Other designs such as pure plastic with a limited movement by
physical housing, to control the hinge input. A type of digital altenmenter that 
varies in resistance could be a high level understanding. Yet the ability 
to utilize the dynamic software parameter capabilities of 255 velocity settings,
capturing the attack as a depth time curve. And providing a range of start and 
stop measurement within the complete hinge sensor design. As a miniture distance
of varying ranges, small spaces coule use a laser per key, with optical data encoded 
on the mini hammers. Expecting to read a position measurement only. An important
design function is scan rate will not have to be at the range for lasers.
As a switch and physical key device, many types of functional designs can
operate. One type of problem is that this keyboard plays differently than
a typical midi keyboard. Soft is soft and hard is hard. With a combination,
and the new amount of variance, often controlling the sensitivity for 
sound output volume. The ability to model intention can be elevated with better
input switches that even cheap keyboard can have, laser optical. Continious scanning left and right
along the hinge. The hinge is encoded with data, and position is read from the microswitch.
Yet the mouse laser offers a dpi, the amount of space of the hinge movement. A center 
rod holding all keys in place with air spring. Bouncy air balloon on near oppsing side
of the lever action. Being able to even adjust the action mechanically by movine it.
Stifness of the keyboard. The hinge structure, attached to the kay inspect via
laser. Ultimately this produces the capability to have very flat keyboards.
Such as the one you are typing on. If the keys were to be read this way,
much more information can be gathered. Such as to place each key on a microball
etched. Telling the side of the key. or an upper case gesture. Lower right tap 
is a function, where the alt key is used now. Accessing two functions
of scrolling gesture upon the surface of the keyboard. Half or even slight
key presses of varied tollerances can achieve functionality. For example
one key surface for bightness, gesture up and down. Tap pause play,
and speaker volume control. In less keys. The functions of 
shift, ctrl, fn, and alt left behind. The tab areas canged to a very nice locking
slider for length of space, and tap or press to tab. Tab is also the table command
if pressed in the upper left corner. Arrow keys are better, full editing. The four 
directions of the typing focus, that blinking carrot.  An inpur and important function.
Zooming gestures from surface contact is appropiate. 

Touchpad sensitivity is of most concern. The functionality of the touchpad gone
saves room. Or even a velocity touch keyboard. The space
key in some modes can be used as a very sensative steering wheel. Not having to 
actually press it. A Left and right input for games. The Idea of an integrated controller
mmixes the realms of portability. Yet resident all of the time encumbering. As
a plastic peice that snaps in place over the top of the laptop, and provides good readings.
One could stick your fingers under the latched keys and utilize the touch pad momentarily.
Often in such circumstances area usage a thumb ball can operate as the mouse.

The attaching of the keyboard without the touch pad, does provide for simplification
and also advancements within the key desice. Turning physical motion, into a plug.
Offering that building the sensor technology into the laptop device while transmission
is purely mechanical is optinum, This enables the readings to be focused
on the domain of quality. One problem however is the laptop is only 
so wide. Connecting all 32 keys should be wireless. The compounding efforts of the 
physical hinge reading offers no quality of keyboard. Built like those hinged plastic
peices on the paper out tray of laser printers. Two pegs pop it into place. Back and white keys.
under the space bar, and near the hammer of the wire frame keyboard, are vertical
hammer sensors. 

Ultimately for an audio device such as a computer daw, keyboards can offer 
the features such as track operation. Knobs and a finger wheel. In the upscale,
perhaps keyboards wirelessly connected to an OS can provide other types of working
technology. Such as the keyboard itself, having a touch screen interface that
is programmed from the wireless signal. As a given method of input, there
are many various methods perhaps to change while playing in select times.
Yet often touch screen perform poorly over time. The size of the finger tip,
and daw information must be summarized greatly. staged in interface. 
Twisting a control is not natural for a touch screen, maybe knobs are too flat.
