/*

Object type for all system connections such as image files, image codecs, audio codecs.
A base wrapper for databases, external .so, program source code to the compiled, index or checked 
for validity. As a method that requires other properties such as querying an interface 
and performing initialization to that interface. Most object types have aliased
pointers that hold context while an outer shell can be manulipated to expose specitif types 
of work loads, parameters, or functions. For example, an object code such as the main image top level,
nodes inside the main image provide linkages to codecs that read it. Partially, fully, decoding.
The main image codec may have five interfaces. The design of codecs, are buffered oriented at times.
