  Much discussion on the meaning and impact of rendering measurements, control,
and also legacy understanding of font placement. Layout and justification with
multiple text flowing capabilities have to be known for the complete field of
text layer to be rendered perhaps. For example, after and underneath effects,
coloring and flow may depending upon size variations encapsolated in layout
computation or even a transparent image. Most likely graphics such as corner
publishments, in the center, should have an extra field or data within the file
that names the over shadow under parts. In the digital image, a polygon path
nameing word locking positions for justification. Marking this in a graphic
asset is much easier than describing it through tag settings.

  Working with user space, a trinket of standard font names exist, yet naming
beyond the few known from corporate network writing, courier, arial, roman,
bookman, san sherif, gothic, and script. If we disect the problem from a
harvested nature, simply the engine of vector storage supplies the rendering
pipeline together with functions that can utilize 2d geometry, and work with
algorithms that are scientific. With the very few routines already borrowed, it
seems that a mountain of code is gone. Now it is time to add more.

  Looking through the character rendering of various Latin fonts listed on the
google page, a program that analyzes the font files extracting the glyph
measurements and organizing by name seems natural. An input of perhaps 1500 font
vectors as a base for statisical study of font names. Aligning each glyph and
storing in a master database measurements that describe the rendering
differences. This is one form of a database that can be stored or used to
organize a feature set for a glyph according to language.

  Expanding on the methods currently in use, most fonts seem to be categorized
about specific in width, reading, Form alteration in sections particular to a
letter. The letters different in sans, serif. The font varies on effect of
curls, square now, Capital letters, and some curls below the Decender line can
be variable control. The signature explicit for each time rendering, single
character change for a particular font to take into account a jitter movement.
Natural variances in some texts can be fortifide in also helping focus perhaps.

  So disecting the characters in language from a meta perspective, one logic
alteration area, and rendering pipeline change. The provisions of knowing the
segment paths where the tick forms on the capital W, a labeling system defines
itself in addition to official terms perhaps. As a range of controlling the sub
gymph vector path can be object oriented.

  A system of dynamically creating fonts by name is a modern feature set in
monochrome color. Yet fonts as a vector system, monochrome, offer the ability to
reintroduce the font nameing convention with more pleasing user desire by
controlling the strength of twenty types of gylph settings at a various strength
  than knowning a name that fits the criteria. The ability to craft the size and
utilize a conformat convention is inviting. Color, and many other new features
affect the name of the font.

  To provide advanced font features will power the browser. The family of
technology in use now is the true type system, an advanced working font system
with every language. The dynamic backbone of the GUI industry. Yet often
connecting the emotion, desire, personal or commercial desire of a font comes
from a range board selection of font names, perhaps types of advanced pet names.
Users know of the massive amount of fonts, perhaps they desire less fonts when
the font browser appears. So dynamically designing a font with normalized
parameters accross the glymph range, characters that have a global contextual
  knowledge of the style settings across the board, numerically set once, form
their curve path, deformation, expansion, wire hashes, to mimic the style of
font.

  for each letter, a large definition will exist that drives the rendering of
the character set. Offering that these settings together names a font, a branded
level of font texture and effects thought of as a base for C++ app central
usage. Ultimately the variance on types of settings, with a known amount of them
as a byte signature, with a byte parameter. Makes font sizes very small, fifty
bytes, plus the name. So rather than load vector data as font data, makes the
engine very small. As well, effects and mood of characters developed by artists,
can now be transfered to other languages through their engine.

  The ability to utilize shapes and a type of library forming image compositing,
communication and parameter based text, or layout configuration from the objects
creates polished visual designs. The ideas of a baloon, or pop up window are to
be energized with shape libraries that inheirit the text layout engine, new font
capabilities.

  A good design can allow wonderful results, empowering the value of screen
resolution to display enhanced text fonts not ever before seen. For example, one
type of design feature that works well for versitility is domain shift operators
for the instruction set. These instructions do not control color but
modification to the base form character. Example,

  engine 1 byte codes, a made up example to tie user space into dynamic font
creation. most likely another uder the cover according to shading. Pre layout,
after layout.

formation - first byte signature domain

  sans
  serif
    Form of a letter with hooks and corners, also called perhaps a swash.
  curl
    looping and also adding artifacts to selected parts.
  vine
    vines forming at strengths with control parameter.

  italic

  edge
    processing edge data seems natural. the ability to deform edges with types
of patterns that are processed into multiple letters by strength. The multiple
point star, with mirrored sides can alter the shape of the letter slightly.
perhaps in the positions selected such as lower left and top right of all
applicable letters that are capital.

  enlarge
    the enlarge command can form multiple meanings.the parameters and effect the
outside of the drawing, or the inside. Parts such as holes in th letter B, or
using the select bytecode command select the bottom hole, and the bottom curve.

    The possibility that the enlarge command parameter, in conjection with a
context, such as if it is within a "part" selection or the inside whole of "g"
and another part, the operation of the command "enlarge" can change. shrink

  square
    flattens by strength whole, or parts. Meaningful settings can also provide
    multiple uses for other parameters. Squaring mode
  skew
  wave
    The wave function is powerful in that it creates miniscule patterns of wave,
or curve pattern data with tesselation variance control. Paper torn edges
together with erode

  swash
  select
    The select can mean a group of particular letters, effect only puncuation,
or finance character. All upper case characters, or just the five characters
that have curls below the decender line. Select is most likely the first,
parameter that selects the entire list of english ones. Other selection modes
could utilize 	top, bottom, left, or	right size for example. Using select to
identify a generalized area followed by a deformation, or strength setting.

  ending
    ending of all of the parts or joins. To control these areas aestically,
size, and parameters. The capital T has about six areas that could be tailored.
  part
    every glyph has a natural selection known from the part, or component. The
point on the capital a, for example, or select all of the letter tops. All
letters with points.

pixmap	domain 2 after render to lumenence mixing values, some systems have
specialized antialias noise film grain, can vary per render of character


bevel
  beveling artifacts for lighting around surface of text outline.


shading
  appearances of text with selective surface shaders. The rendering system
  provides the ability to place smooth bump stripes, Styling with, wavy, organic
patterns, symetrical yet partically instructed patterns,  emblem artifacts known
to aid in quality. This occurs without downloading image data, the textures are
generated.

There are fifteen, a bitstream after compacting. Perhaps the pixmap context
change will contain image processing that adds luminence effects to the pixel.
Film grain, noises, edge deterioration, inner brightness contrasts. pattern
embossing, varying tiny decals inside painting. controlling the bevel also.


When this system of byte codes are compressed down to a bit stream, new commands
within the domain, occupy the same bit sequence as the previous. But the new
context gives those positions newer meaning.

To capture the reading sized text for screend and large HD screen print,
television prints, smart tv rendering and new rendering technologies as a vector
system means that its font system is compiled for the video card, and the screen
technology.

Consumer tv with glitter, greatness and readibility in print, menu systems, and
animated painting sprites can elevate the mood.
