a software attachement to the video card abstraction layer using 
the existing components such as vulcan and opengl. The capability
of the software to exist as a llvm instaniated interface to an instance
of the video card make it possible to provide a better form
of clipping and capabilities. The extensiveness of the scene graph 
collection should be base functional parts of the system to incorporate
into process animation. By placing multiple compiler requirements together,
other forms of shader can be utilized. Yet the focus of the library is
manufactureing game graphics as a bse system.Easily integrated into 
display with the text and rendering system. Integration with the UI
component is also a consideration. Developed text and textures are 
necessary to transmit from the vfont text system. Beveling data, and 
lighting data. The system can use the same timeing data nd animation 
system as the 2d vector. Rate and time changes with events.

The system of drawing commands can be translated to ship the vector drawing
to the video cards. Although most drawing is done by software filling. Textures.

A programming language that can function with the model parts on the page,
to create charismatic and integrated to events on the page, is likely
to have held many different contexts in the past. Yet a consolidated
language around posing characters is likely. A Langauge for houses.
A language for objects, and developing an engine around those recursive
problems that are not object programs. Abstracted and controlled for 
domain. Yet as functional scenegraph components, the scenegraph itself
an object requiring a type of point point data for its calculations. 
Mesh vertex, and index, texturing. The primary aspect of the object
system is to build models within a specific range of polygons, 
texture amounts and shader usage. Providing communication to shaders
as a type of library function is possible. Typicaaly these are small
transform programs that are executed manytimes during the rendering 
process for affected areas. Just adding one, can make a glow. I have 
only glanced at the capabilities yet not competent in the versitility.

Yet it does appear as a programming language likely c++, or c
and there are existing programs that compile the language and 
produce suitable code for the actual microprocessor or GPU.
Many existing systems have undergone exitensive rework. 
Therefore building a library of these routines, as a type of 
template, some may be chained together to create more layered
aspects to the transformation. The usage of the LLVM system
to produce these as part of the reference in a store BC format
form linking can produce functional and more advanced inroads
to current usage implementation. Knowedge of shader capability
and using the library to show leather couches with grains, beauty,
some vinyal, textured and layed by blankets. In the light
cast in the living room. The couch object makes sustainable
environments for very advanced. The ability to summarize model
settings should be very consolidated, as a binary representation,
representing modes supported as base. Each base has parameter 
and styles. Mixing two styles as a simply variable control weight
to give one more weight. Then again the overall model can be controlled
corsly at the higher level, to design its space size within the geometric
metric volume of the proposed environment. As separate functional
object programs that form the requirement, value is added, as 
each component has multiplex features, even can be in their own languages
as part of control. Verbose binary function calls. LOD and geospacial
communication by the scenegraph object provide context. The parameters
to the object preserve in space along with the capability to link
the object directly to other reactionary visitor requests. Can functional
requirements be sustained? Most likely never in describing the Diamond
ring object. A new wonder to utilize in extensive lighting considitions,
next to the cave fire in a game. Yet the ability to preserve the 
intention of the diamond will have to live on. 

Most likely a protocol communication format for object discovery
with on board documentation. Emotional communication. About form the house,
diamond, car, or types of smart object, the reference of a noun 
pbased program likely to design types of high level summary for its 
particular part in game play. To make do in the world
as this is an approximation. One that will have to be traversed to
find a type of compression between building quality models.
And algorithmically furfilling the necessary target audience 
with inheirted pallets of shader requests, textures, gradients.


Models in a form, should communicate more inteltially their approximate
physics. Giving the production a better effort. The forms of surface
elasticity. Weight. Acoustial approximations of various sound 
attenuations at the objects requested view. In game play, explosions,
bullets, and fire remark of the contents. More identity and breakdown of 
fire, and consuming time as it goes out. The gradual decrase of the effect
over time. Some very large states but excluded. The third control on fire and
cross over to embers with the puff of smoke. The couch always has the bullet
holes attached, if game play suggests that one can traverse the world 
as a functional concept. Object storage provides the effect of minimal exposure of the 
details.
