a software attachement to the video card abstraction layer using 
the existing components such as vulcan and opengl. The capability
of the software to exist as a llvm instaniated interface to an instance
of the video card make it possible to provide a better form
of clipping and capabilities. The extensiveness of the scene graph 
collection should be base functional parts of the system to incorporate
into process animation. By placing multiple compiler requirements together,
other forms of shader can be utilized. Yet the focus of the library is
manufactureing game graphics as a bse system.Easily integrated into 
display with the text and rendering system. Integration with the UI
component is also a consideration. Developed text and textures are 
necessary to transmit from the vfont text system. Beveling data, and 
lighting data. The system can use the same timeing data nd animation 
system as the 2d vector. Rate and time changes with events.

The system of drawing commands can be translated to ship the vector drawing
to the video cards. Although most drawing is done by software filling. Textures.
