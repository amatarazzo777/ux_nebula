\date 10/21/20
\version 1.0
\brief the file encapsulates the rendering platform base and its interface
technology. The rendering system ues the cairo, glib, librsvg. pango,
pango-cairo, freetype2, harfbuzz, and many more dependencies. Their availability
on multiple platforms with durability in design and thought on performance give
an edge to the amount of code that is require to provide the library. Often, it
is desirable to increase and decrease at the same time. THis can be accomplished
methodically though analysis and break down. Perhaps additional methods can
apply other rendering technology.
