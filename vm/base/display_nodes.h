  Examples of formats

    cpp header format is a format that provides inclusion of the
    shape within a program's binary. A const static unsign char array
    filled by the image provided in encoded hexidecimal, the information
    is bit packed and compressed. The segments should be rather small
    but can also include raster image data.

    providing for externalization of image data from the data data
    can be more functional. The image data is not outdata by resolution.
    Part of the parameters may be the passing of image data for the
    shape control to use. The image data could also support directory
    based.

  Inside the IDE the formats can be interchanged between visual editing and,
  code tags for the shape. The format is distinct from the SVG vector, it
  is still unusual that a text painter can out performed a hand stylus tool.
  Or crafted editing. Therefore the use of the form as a byte oriented one
  provides consolidation. specific options within the tool provide for
  programming events, providing interfaces to the shape as a function.
