# UX Nebula OS design

This project is a research API for the C++ 17 and above language to provide a document object model for visualization. By supplying a jotted plan, with some proven methods of solving problems, academic and product planning can become a less risky plan. Simply by supplying the development and structured planning, new avenues of serious technology deployment can strategically update the technology curve.
The visualization layer is typically instantiated by legacy models, except for the tried and true Java Model. One part of the product can be designed to be cross-platform, C++ ux DOM.  The template dom library works precisely with the standard library without adding new data types. It supports rapid development and incorporates a small set of memorable names within its model. Together with a simplified yet robust layer for the OS style supports, audio, networking and the many other accouterments, a realized model of system and event design that applies to multiple kernel technologies. Yet as a primary use, the POSIX kernel with the very few calls that it has, such as Linux kernel, the system design may be accelerated by utilizing the model.

It is a templated oriented implementation for higher performance and integrated syntax. It offers the document object model integrated with C++ language as a natural syntax that appears like HTML because of the use of &lt;&gt;. The following development platforms and rendering technologies are capable of use for development and distribution.

Research into method of invocation of newer font systems that do not utilize external sources. Better projection,and art amazement with the coloring of vector fonts. Natural and logical soft font sizes and enhance rendering that is solved algorithmically. 

Development of kernel loading, from package sources, compile and handoff to graphic image for video driver loading. 

Designing application life cycle using a combination of upgraded technology patterns. Limiting scope to the system layer. Integrating the language compiler, and not using the garbage collector for languages of the kernel. Or use? Integration of pretty printing, and debugging facilities as part of the development. Produces documentation about the language from composite documentation, allowing for new things to be documented and providing for valuable documentation about expression, statements, and additions to statements inheirited.

Designing the document object model and also compiler language facilities to automate facets of 
generating. Integrating the basic problems of language construction by providing cross system interoperability using a memory oriented scheme with high throughput. Adaptively changing interfaces and providing context for polymorphic types planned well. Much faster and efficient box types for direct language use. Generate language parsers using the visitor pattern and importing existing language properties, documentation, debugging, ide, and with Bison grammer and c++ visitor filled in, new languages can be fashioned. Worded and also operating on a liked bounds. Also parsing formats and introducing transforms that are native formatting for document object model display. The available objects produced from the process includes parsers that will point to the error. When programs are well formed, break the program down into a binary format, representing in less space the language constructions, program and calls.

A template programming language with data type, structure, and logic, that is class based, and supports basic types of memory, mutex, and system calls. Import abi calls. Not designed for a display, but for loading as a genetic library for language use. For example, writing a set of base library routines for string, paragraph, indexing, table of contents, btree, arrays, linked lists, double links, or other types of genetic algorithms. Languages may utilize them with their types, attaching to the keys. Data table searching, and adaptive storage are often overlooked at the system layer, providing that each instaniation utilize their own interface. Templates provide the ability to orient performance. Inheritance in template design also provides useful groups of object or module templates.

One of the best methods for acheieving performance on systematic booting proceedures, is merely recording a summary to be recompiled. Template language design can support facilities by incorporating
object query methods. That is, by logging processes and low level driver usages, from the boot sector loading to fixed hardware capability for the device. Changing the layer for what is known as Plymouth rock, the grub boot loader position to a device deticated experience.

Automated image mixing with transparency in text layout is a useful tool. In this, rendering glyph text may reside in non square bounds flowing within image compisitie layer.  Polygon flowing areas of text may be designed visually as part of the digital image. Graceful character glyphs with built in styles further defines reading areas aesthetically. 

Research into a stream format for information and data entry fields. The SGML definitions change according to scope. The main perspective is tailoring to audiences for a type of writing markup. Maintaining a user domain focus for select ages. For example, a user writing a series of context 
SGML markups may more consistently define data entry forms, appearance of text.

      #include "viewManager.hpp" using namespace std; using namespace ViewManager;

      int main(int argc, char argv) {

       auto &vm = createElement<Viewer>(
              objectTop{10_pct}, objectLeft{10_pct}, objectHeight{80_pct},

              vm << "Hello World\n";  
              vm.render();
        }



The use of exterior words apart from the standard c++ library often shows some modifications that may be well liked. To utilize the push_back, delete, insert keywords and provide c++ algorithm support may be over design. These functions can be added to provide like STD syntax. Review and simplify if necessary. Adding  these routines in place of createElement. One may also simply provide call through template classes named like the STD. Does it make the code more readable? Downfalls?  Here is an example.

      auto e=vm.push_back<h1>({});


Evaluate system design complexity. Less code and more elegant algorithms. How much data should the system be able to handle, or expected to handle? The limits of a usable interface should be met well before processing nature of the machine. Providing upper bounds is important, and security of compositions within a window box. That is, well behaved applications merely occupy their visual window and not traversal of programs apart.

Because the font system is embedded without downloadable fonts, it depends on less unsecure data. The nature of X11 transport is created here, as is the rudimentary stream type for information displays transposed from html web page layouts to a rendering pipeline. Limiting the prospects of ever supporting all features of the browser, there can be some types of transfer support for the native layout of books, with images, games, etc. Where the format is just loaded and displayed. Routines of components plugged in, and simple logic to handle all business needs. Much more effective than the Javascript language for database entry applications. In fact language definition and modern compiler design has to advance to support these technologies. The ability to craft simple computer language files, plug it into the system and utilize more summarization techniques, and encapsolation, offers using perhaps LLVM. The scope of producing efficient code is seen with c++, yet how much input is required to provide these types of results on object oriented designs is difficult to know. For example there are a hugh number of options for call sites to know about, yet perhaps only a few of them will be used. Use of the AST data structure and recursion with a tokenizer is how modern expressions are typically evaluated. The integrated comparisons and vector types, memory allocation, rely on stack space, or heap space. 

A feature to design is the linking of an object to be accomplished completely in memory, such that the program's internal memory management is mostly the user's choice. It is important to remember that Gui memory and other object data in some system designs may reside within another process space requiring the use of shared memory. It is of interest to maximize development of transfer options to invoke a container using a type of protocol that transfers the data without future changes. This can work using loaded symbol files that stores a protocol table, for example. The database_t template format is designed to encompass the requirements. As a binary construct, an internal branch structure that supports dynamic protocol building, and array access to native and compiled types is achievable. Objects that function quickly ultimately must depend on no transfers of data. 



Yet it is known that the standard library is not within space and does not implement a protocol format. For example, templates can be designed with select template query functions that test for constexpr that make allowable code path productions possible. One use is to tailor the routine around this distinction. There are also other types of advanced template functions that provide static code polymorphism, testing if a base type is within the inherited stack.  So for example, testing if the container or element supports raw data transfer of its memory location as a size or structure allows it to be automatically transferred as a data type to the rendering process. The complete package of data elements within a shared memory buffer as a whole is best. Parts of it locked and managed. 

So the testing of the STL version and capabilities are evident for some features, more projects in other departments of system design. new component systems for native c++, memory linking, container, vector storage. Other types of problem solvers can utilize protocol style buffers to develop real time call site mechanisms to versioned interface objects. One hugh problems with object growth style is too many interface changes, outdated functionality. The loading of a binary foot print within the (.so) binary file file that is selective while other parts are not needed is useful in updating linktime components. Thereby agreeing to a level of depreciation.  

Interfaces often grow to add support for functional updates in other industry areas, and then are modified to be technically ineffective as a whole, and hence altered forms are adopted in the future. Simple changes that can be described through comparison and analysis to promote automatic updating of software is advanced. A C++ program that runs in the future, and adopts a liked interface portion, style, control pallette, has to be planned well. One remark is that in such uncompromising circumstances where all cannot be provided, is that generalizations be in place. SUch as 
centeralized recognition of styles for font display.

One focus of the HTML brand is that within the group of writers, one expects ordinary writers to accomplish the tags. There are all sorts of tags flying around, yet as a writer some tags do provide sense. The ability to more accurately define a useful layout language that also can inheirit addition SGML namespaces such as academic MLA, or Universal Addresses, or Control Patterns makes better building block sense to expose them in layout technology. Therefore the mode of the page tags should offer exciting possibilities for an audience. The usefulness of this dynamic tag declaration supplied within base system can be effective. The Element object supplies this functionality through inheirtance. Offering a useul consolidated approach to audience style writing, and modes of writing can be useful to many people. This method of template C++ DOM provides this easily.

In testing the system, programs that try to crash the system with all types of obsecure work, some resulting from errors, or invalid data, should be crafted. Building a system full of error messages is excellent for business systems. Yet routines that are within a domain of logic can be expected to operate without errors on input. In low level algorithm programming it is often necessary to skip error on input to achieve throughput. 

While the code is built based upon nomenclature HTML basic tags, to invoke. Modifying the c++ template to yeild placement into a raw pointer node tree can be useful. The task of pointer management of this kind has been solved manytimes before, problems do come again. As an enhancement, moving away from small token within the function namespace to a well spell out method tends to offer programming companionship. Such as instead of createElement< H1 > to using more of a c++ street legal academic terminology, to createElement<H1_t>({}), or createElement<heading_t<1>>({}). Moving away from some condensed forms to more structured labels. These questions should be prized.

Designing edit components was a shift in methodology to craft them in the pure browser languages. Yet as a mixture, native and new controls should rely on object oriented inheritance. The work of entering a character, designing a wisiwig document editor, and the like has become embedded solely in the javascript world. To build a system that can provide extensive editing features, grammer, spelling, and the consumer versus business audience publishing is well deserved in designing as a base feature object. Therefore component engineering to supply the longevity should utilize the mix component rendering technology. 

Forms of gradient definition within the color tag. Color should also support image, etc. Perhaps the system buildup will include an object that simply encapsulates the entire engine as a stream context with a discrete focus on types of functionality that are plug in based. As a reusable object, with an encoded binary stream input for function invocation brevity. A stream with graphic database file loading. Parts of the stream exists to instruct the dynamic alteration of the graphic asset in multiple forms, even over time. For example, making a series of 2d curves shaped differently as its beautification attributes are used. The ability to set up a rendering chain that is complex with multiple types of compositie graphics, and animation layers is a easily adopted figure.

Especially within the color tag, gradient producer, or effects. As a friend class of the nodes, inspecting the analyzed output from 2d vector queries, quadrant area significance, blending, and unification within the animation aesthetics provides effective display capabilities. 

Many have tried before and simply decided to increase complexity. Yet as a font object, can more intelligent decisions be made by the system as a group. Typically the infrastructure of font systems, as a granular focus, offer pop, push and stack instructions The effectiveness of rendering nicely solved by vector data and pure code on the other side seems inviting. As a tailored approach using less data, intelligent processed letter, word, and advanced quick raster data moves. Often antialias details of this nature might be three pixels for normal reading texts.

In addition to the new visualization and event system, base OS features will support dynamic language creation. The use of compatible protocol data algorithms allows for cross language support. The object system of the base of is very robust in design. The summary below encapsolates necessary
areas for complete OS package.

Research investment

Yet what do these capabilities provide for an investor? 

1) As seen in the everyday user's point of view, one can expect that newer types of embedded devices are distinctly more cost-efficient and tailored for use. Ergonomically user devices may be selective in that the physical device, software desktop, and application designs be more intentional to abstract usages. By simplifying the visual layer, and accompanying other OS facilities, new desktop designs may be realized much easier.
2) A valuable server process chain that provides composite OS image production for specific machine architectures may be derived and fashioned. The capability to eliminate the "middle man" in OS software production can be realized in types of WYSIWYG tools and components. That is allowing less technical design and deployment using a server build chain. Simply, the user paints the desktop design and behaviors, clicks options and the server software produces a bootable image. The image can be tailored for installation style, or more likely a binary footprint distributed at the product manufacturing level.
3) Software that is typically more focused, smaller, and better designed is much easier to manage. The measurements of host processor speed can imply specific modeling for software distribution. In short, faster, smaller, and scales to platform requirements. The software is distributed to smaller less capable devices, tailored.
4) Inventive embedded devices that support commercial uses and publishing. Gaming and interactive software are primarily related to younger generations. Gaming software may be processor and memory-intensive. The low-level design of the Nebula OS provides an inroad for producing visually compelling yet inexpensive gaming devices.
5) Market leverage and holistic scientific designs can alleviate audience complaints. That is, the base API, usefulness, disregards legacy technology names, and implements a meaningful ordered name set. As development and research drive market availability, the system design streamlines language and IDE creation as a base facility. Software deployment to the user space utilizes a subset of the dependent objects that reduces footprint size.
6) Very competitive next-generation vector font system that integrates user style control over rendering. Rendering artifacts such as aesthetic add-on images, glyph set alteration, and font style control are distributed in separate object files. That is, not the TTF file. The font system can be tailored in design to be independent of the TTF system, to not require the download of vector shape drawing. The alternative rendering from font style is described in real-world terms, allowing the writer/designer to be specific. Smart Televisions are much more visually reactive.
7) The updated rendering component, supplies a smaller and more compact design. Realizing the capabilities of web page layout design in very few calls. The facilities are available to any computing language.

Detriments of using the Linux environment
1) At times, the facilities of device drivers are not as robust as supplied by the manufacture for the linux. For example, the NVIDIA driver, has multiple editions, open source and proprietary. In this, more deticated manufacture relationship is required to furfill the product stability. At times, tactically foriegn manufactures utilize "design flaws" to express other worldly problems. This is typically rooted in audience awareness, Microsoft verses linux scientific. The mangement of these assets is difficult. 
2) The level of experience for design and coding requires recruiting specific resources.
3) An industry complaint, moving away from standards. That is, software written, while in many languages, will be applied to only the new standard of the Nebula OS. The object system, font vector rendering, and additional base features make software useless for all platforms. The system deployment can be designed such that base OS objects are supported by additional libraries on other platforms as an interface exists. Yet this is a known, Mac software that does not compile and run on a Windows machine. The usefulness of standard code syntax is apparent. The whole industry adopts them as a starting position. 
4) Linux kernel is open source and often over-designed. Yet as a code management facility, the kernel is a large project. Replacing may be difficult.

In conclusion, the market value is the scope of implementation. The capability to establish
functional designs, and increase the capability to produce applications, or software relies on the design and architecture intelligence of the implementation. Limiting the scope of the product to a very useful design reduces the development costs and risks. Creating a robust development tool environment is a primary stage. Subsequent derived technologies rely on coded behaviors of the desktop or system readout. Therefore the process of project management
should presume to build software that allows known future feature sets.
